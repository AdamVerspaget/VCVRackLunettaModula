<h2>User Guide</h2>
Inspired by the works of Stanley Lunetta who's Moosack Machines were experimental electronic instruments made from digital integrated circuits, these modules represent raw building blocks that can be patched together to create your own "Lunetta". 
Please note these are NOT normal synth modules, they are in no way HiFi and are probably fit for experimental use only.

Most modules represent CMOS integrated circuits and are named after thier assocated part numbers (CDxxxx) . Details on how each one works can be found by searching for the part number in your favourite internet search engine. Any module without a CDxxxx number is outlined below.

<ul>
Basic operational notes:
<li>Logic level lnputs are designated by red jacks.</li>
<li>Logic level outputs are designated by blue jacks.</li>
<li>As these are emulations of primitve CMOS integrated circuits, the logic levels are based on the "power supply" and in this case will be 0-12V. As with most CMOS integrated circuits, there are no schmitt triggers on the inputs unless otherwise stated for a given module. The threshold for the transition from one state to another has been arbitrarily set at 6 volts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Buttons</h3>
This is a set of six manual logic buttons than can be configured idividually to operate in either latched or momentary fashion via the context menu.
